## What is this?

AbsolutelySkilled is a collection of skills that teach AI agents domain-specific knowledge - from framework APIs to marketing strategy. Each skill is a self-contained folder with structured markdown that agents load on demand.

Skills work with any agent that supports the SKILL.md format: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, and [40+ more agents](#supported-agents).

---

## Flagship Skills

These three skills form the backbone of AbsolutelySkilled - install them first and watch your AI agent transform from a code assistant into an autonomous development partner.

### Superhuman - AI-Native Development Lifecycle

Traditional development methods - Agile, Waterfall, TDD - were built around human constraints: limited parallelism, context switching costs, and meeting overhead. **Superhuman** throws all of that out and rebuilds the SDLC from scratch for AI agents.

Give it a feature request, and Superhuman will:

1. **Interview you** to extract requirements, constraints, and success criteria
2. **Decompose** the work into a dependency-graphed DAG of atomic sub-tasks
3. **Research** each task by exploring your codebase and docs in parallel
4. **Plan** test-first implementation strategies per task
5. **Execute** tasks in parallel waves - independent tasks run simultaneously via sub-agents
6. **Verify** every task with TDD, lint, typecheck, and build checks
7. **Converge** with a self code review, requirements validation, and full project verification

Everything is tracked on a persistent `.superhuman/board.md` that survives across sessions - resume where you left off, audit decisions, or hand off to another developer.

```
INTAKE --> DECOMPOSE --> DISCOVER --> PLAN --> EXECUTE --> VERIFY --> CONVERGE
```

```bash
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --skill superhuman
```

### Second Brain - Persistent Memory for AI Agents

Every time you start a new conversation, your AI agent forgets everything it learned in the last one. **Second Brain** fixes that.

It turns `~/.memory/` into a structured, hierarchical knowledge store that persists across projects, sessions, and tools. Your agent remembers your preferences, workflows, debugging techniques, and domain expertise - automatically loading only what's relevant to the current context.

- **Tag-indexed retrieval** - memories are scored against your current context and only the top matches are loaded (no wasted tokens)
- **100-line ceiling** - files stay small and split automatically, keeping context window usage efficient
- **Wiki-linked graph** - memories cross-reference each other with `[[wiki-links]]` for rich knowledge traversal
- **Auto-propose learnings** - after complex tasks, your agent suggests what to remember for next time
- **CRUSP lifecycle** - Create, Read, Update, Split, Prune - your memory stays fresh and organized

Your agent goes from amnesia to institutional knowledge in one install.

```bash
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --skill second-brain
```

## Install Skills

Skills are installed using the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI via `npx`.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install all skills from this registry
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled

# List available skills before installing
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --list

# Install a specific skill
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --skill clean-code

# Install multiple specific skills
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --skill clean-code --skill backend-engineering

# Install globally (available across all projects)
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled -g

# Install to a specific agent
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled -a claude-code

# Non-interactive install (CI/CD friendly)
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --skill clean-code -g -a claude-code -y

# Install all skills to all agents
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --all
```

### Install Options

| `-l, --list` | List available skills without installing |
| `--copy` | Copy files instead of symlinking |
| `-y, --yes` | Skip all confirmation prompts |
| `--all` | Install all skills to all agents without prompts |

### Installation Scope

| Scope | Flag | Location | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Project** | (default) | `./<agent>/skills/` | Committed with your project, shared with team |
| **Global** | `-g` | `~/<agent>/skills/` | Available across all projects |

### Managing Skills
