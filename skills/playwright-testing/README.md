# playwright-testing

Use this skill when writing Playwright e2e tests, debugging flaky tests, setting up visual regression, testing APIs with request context, configuring CI sharding, or automating browser interactions. Triggers on Playwright, page.route, storageState, toHaveScreenshot, trace viewer, codegen, test.describe, page object model, and any task requiring Playwright test automation or flaky test diagnosis.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --skill playwright-testing
```

## Overview

Playwright runs real Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers from a single API with auto-waiting, network interception, and built-in assertions. This skill focuses on what Claude gets wrong by default: auth state management, flaky test diagnosis, CI optimization, and the subtle gotchas that burn hours. Includes executable scripts for project setup, flaky test diagnosis, and safe snapshot updates.
