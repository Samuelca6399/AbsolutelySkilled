# real-time-streaming

Use this skill when building real-time data pipelines, stream processing jobs, or change data capture systems. Triggers on tasks involving Apache Kafka (producers, consumers, topics, partitions, consumer groups, Connect, Streams), Apache Flink (DataStream API, windowing, checkpointing, stateful processing), event sourcing implementations, CDC with Debezium, stream processing patterns (windowing, watermarks, exactly-once semantics), and any pipeline that processes unbounded data in motion rather than data at rest.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --skill real-time-streaming
```

## Overview

A practitioner's guide to building and operating real-time data pipelines. This skill
covers the full stack of stream processing - from ingestion (Kafka producers, CDC with
Debezium) through processing (Kafka Streams, Apache Flink) to materialization (sinks,
materialized views, event-sourced stores). The focus is on production-grade patterns:
exactly-once semantics, backpressure handling, state management, and failure recovery.
Designed for engineers who understand distributed systems basics and need concrete
guidance on building streaming pipelines that run reliably at scale.
