## Overview

This is the **orchestrator skill** for end-to-end video creation. It coordinates
a complete 7-step workflow that takes a user from "I need a video" to a finished
4K render. Each step delegates to companion skills (remotion-video,
video-scriptwriting, video-audio-design, video-analyzer) while this skill
manages sequencing, approval gates, and handoffs between stages.

You do NOT need to know Remotion internals or audio engineering - those are
handled by companion skills. This skill's job is to run the process, ask the
right questions, and make sure nothing gets skipped.
